# GeometryBin
I didn't like how the built in trig functions worked in BASH so I made my own as well as a system for dot products and cross products of those.
To make this work just put these in your ~/bin folder (if it doesn't exist then make one), make the files executable (chmod +x filename), and you should be able to enter 3D vectors delimited by a space.
